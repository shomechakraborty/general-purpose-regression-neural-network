# general-purpose-regression-neural-network

Programmed By: Shome Chakraborty

INTRODUCTION

- This program is a general purpose regression neural network model which can be used to predict target values using data in a variety of quantitative applications. This model is designed to capture and learn from complex relationships and patterns between quantitative data in order to develop a robust predictive ability beyond traditional regression. Users can provide the model training data and several hyperparameters based on their specific predictive application which the model will train on. Users can run their custom trained model on input features in order to obtain predictive values for their respective use-case or application. The model is designed to be fine-tuned to a userâ€™s application and preferences, while providing for optimized regression training and data analysis.

- This model is inspired by a previous neural network model I developed, which was designed to specialize in the prediction of housing prices. I had fixed, adjusted, and built upon core feature of that model in the development of this program, providing more robust and accurate functionality for this program.
